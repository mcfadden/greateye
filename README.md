IPCamera video management tool.

Think of this as a way to do something useful with your IP cameras.

This is very much a work in progress. It's basically missing all the documentation, and was originally designed to solve a single, very specific need. I've been expanding support out for additional cameras, more customization, and documented setup, but none of that is done yet.

Check back later?
